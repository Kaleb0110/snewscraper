       " 'Trump card over Republicans hard to beat\\nThe two articles of impeachment against US President Donald Trump were drafted in the House of Representatives, but the trial is taking place in the Senate and requires a two-thirds majority, or 67 out of 100 senators, to remove him from office. \\n\\rChief Justice John Roberts is presiding over the trial and the 100 senators are the \"jury.\" \\n\\rI have been watching it every night. You can catch the main highlights on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah.\\n\\rThe rules are murky and the question now is whether witnesses can be subpoenaed, as former national security adviser John Bolton has blown the whistle on Trump in his upcoming book. \\n\\rThe leading impeachment manager, Adam Schiff, managed to extract from Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, a three-day opening submission for his team and three days for the Trump defense team. Schiff made a powerful opening with the help of video testimony.\\n\\rAssuming all 47 members of the Democratic Party stick together, it would require at least four Republicans to carry a motion to subpoena Bolton. \\n\\rThe four most likely to break ranks could be Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah. \\n\\rI say this because Collins has gone on Twitter to say that \"reports about Bolton\\'s book have strengthened the case for witnesses and have prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues.\" \\n\\rI understand that if the vote is split 50:50, the chief justice makes the final decision, although the rules for impeachment trials are silent on this point. \\n\\rEven McConnell has acknowledged privately that he currently does not have the votes to avoid calling witnesses, which the Democrats want to do.\\n\\rIn the impeachment trial of then president Bill Clinton, the issue never came up, so there is no precedent. \\n\\rBut three legal experts have written in the New York Times that Roberts could call witnesses as he is the presiding officer. \\n\\rEven if Bolton was subpoenaed, Trump may apply to prevent him from speaking on grounds of executive privilege, to which the Democrats will argue there are limits. \\n\\rIn the meantime, the 100 senators are suffering as they can only drink water or milk on the Senate floor and must lock up their phones and not communicate with each other during the trial. \\n\\rMost, if not all of them, are wearing Apple Watches and trying not to fall asleep. \\n\\rSchiff has a law degree from Harvard University and is a former federal prosecutor. \\n\\rAssisting him are Jerry Nadler, who served on the judiciary committee, Zoe Lofgren, Jason Crow, Sylvia Garcia, Hakeem Jeffries and Val Demings - all appointed by Nancy Pelosi.\\n\\rTrump\\'s defense team consists of Alan Dershowitz, Eric Herschmann, Ken Starr, Pam Bondi, Pat Cipollone, Mike Purpura and Trump\\'s personal attorney Jay Sekulow. \\n\\rThey argued that Trump did not do anything wrong and even if he did, it does not amount to an impeachable offense. \\n\\rBut what I find so strange is the lack of power on the part of the House to obtain documents and to call witnesses, as well as a similar lack of power on the part of the chief justice to order that they be produced, leading Trump to brag at the Davos summit that he has all the material and the Democrats do not. \\n\\rThe biggest jury trial may well turn out to be a farce and a travesty of justice unless the Republicans show some backbone.\\n\\rSusan Liang is a lawyer who likes to speak her mind on issues that concern the man on the street\\n',\n",
       " 'Investing in unsettled times\\nI ran into Midland Holdings chairman Freddie Wong Kin-yip at the Hong Kong Jockey Club clubhouse, where he had just finished swimming laps.\\n\\rWong takes good care of his health and keeps a diligent swimming schedule, so he is very fit. A strong, healthy body is more important than money, he said.\\n\\rA prominent real estate broker for many years, Wong has long achieved financial security. He is savvy in investment, so I asked him for tips regarding the market outlook.\\n\\rHe laughed and told me to perhaps look at bonds. For example, he says, higher risk mainland real-estate bonds are paying a rather handsome interest of more than 10 percent per annum. Companies that are generally safe are also paying 6 to 7 percent. Individual bonds issued by overseas financial institutions, such as the Royal Bank of Scotland, are also an option.\\n\\rLocals like to invest in real estate, and as the market has come down recently, is it a good time to buy? Wong said self-use buyers may consider buying if they come across \"bargain\" properties that are priced at 10 percent or more below market value. Such properties do exist as some people who want to emigrate are in a hurry to sell.\\n\\rSome feel that recent local social developments have diminished the SAR\\'s prospects. Wong said one should first ask if Hong Kong, having a deposit stockpile of HK$13 trillion and foreign reserve at HK$3 trillion, would lose its role as the mainland\\'s treasure trove.\\n\\rRecently, he said, a mainland tycoon spent HK$290 million to purchase multiple new apartments through Midland. Hong Kong immigrants in foreign countries live the life of second-class citizens earning third-class incomes. After death, a big chunk of the assets they have left behind would go to the government, he observed.\\n\\rWould those who had been immigrants before not treasure a life in Hong Kong as a first-class citizen making a first-class income?\\n\\rSo Wong ventured to conclude that so long as the Lantau Tomorrow Vision project is not implemented, it is highly unlikely that the local property market will crash.\\n\\rSiu Sai-wo is publisher of Sing Tao Daily\\n',\n",
       " \"Crisis management for all to Practice, Support and Observe \\nThe statutory Lunar New Year holidays have come and gone, although most of us are on extended leave from the office and school to avoid spending time on crowded public transport and areas to minimize exposure to deadly viruses, in particular the Wuhan coronavirus, for which human-to-human transmission is now confirmed as one possible mode of infection. \\n\\rAlthough this is not officially confirmed, the virus is thought to be carried by bats, which are hunted and eaten by palm civets, which are in turn hunted and illegally sold live in markets in regions where the locals have a rather exotic taste for wild animals, especially in the winter. \\n\\rViral outbreaks do occur from time to time in history and have killed many until cures are found. \\n\\rIn the past, they were contained locally. But with modern-day high speed rail and air travel, human carriers can go from local to global in no time.\\n\\rShort of closing border crossings and banning travel completely, enforcement of selective closures is easier said than done. \\n\\rTake two of the Hong Kong cases for example, both involving Wuhan residents. \\n\\rOne family flew from Wuhan to Singapore and spent a few days there before flying here. Their fever only surfaced after they had checked into their hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui.\\n\\rAnother couple took the high-speed rail from Wuhan to Shenzhen, and then took another train here. \\n\\rThey developed a fever only after arriving at their relative's flat in Ma On Shan.\\n\\rSo, do we stop all land, sea and air travel altogether, short and long haul? \\n\\rThat is not practical. \\n\\rAnd with the number of Hong Kong residents going abroad for their Lunar New Year break in the six-figures, we are obliged to take them back, regardless of whether they are sick or not. \\n\\rOn the closure of borders, there is another dimension.\\n\\rThe fact is that a very high percentage of our fresh food comes from the mainland. \\n\\rAny slowdown in or ban on travel and transportation in the mainland and at our border may mean the food supply chain may be constrained for a few months, as the virus and associated emergency health and hygiene measures are forecast to continue until the summer months.\\n\\rDespite the above complications, the latest emergency measures by the government to close high-speed train and through-train services are to be supported. \\n\\rLet's hope they reduce unnecessary travel and enable more concentrated border checks.\\n\\rThe yearly National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference meetings are scheduled to take place in early March in Beijing. \\n\\rPriority must be given to legislation or strengthening of existing laws that ban and criminalize the catching, breeding, trafficking, selling, cooking and eating of wild animals and birds that are capable of carrying and transmitting viruses which endanger health.\\n\\r Edward Chow is a current affairs commentator\\n\",\n",
